# Week 2: Basic Honggfuzz Usage

[Honggfuzz](https://honggfuzz.dev) is a easy-to-use fuzzer developed by Google which has found [many vulnerabilities](https://github.com/google/honggfuzz#trophies).
We will be using it to rediscover an infinite recursion denial-of-service vulnerability in [Xpdf](https://www.xpdfreader.com).
**We recommend that you type out the commands in this exercise (except for URLs) instead of copying and pasting them.
This will help you remember things.**

This exercise is based on [Fuzzing101 Exercise 1](https://github.com/antonio-morales/Fuzzing101/tree/main/Exercise%201).
